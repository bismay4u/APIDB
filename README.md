# APIDB Server

A multipurpose Database Gateway that can be used as Database Gateway for secure remote connections, on premise data connections using LPI (Logiks Plugin Interface), 
as driver library to database via npmjs and as MCP server for GenAI projects.

Today, the speed of OpenSource Development has increased immensely. Getting drivers for all databases on various languages is becoming difficult with time. So we created this project, which acts as a single point for all database connectivity. Why, NodeJS database drivers are one of the fastest updating libraries.
